# Prometheus

**Your own AI. On your own machine. Hybrid by design.**

Prometheus is a personal AI assistant that lives on your desktop. It runs local models through Ollama for fast, private tasks, and reaches out to cloud models for heavy lifting — all within a single conversation. It connects to your real browser, controls your desktop, manages your email and calendar, and talks to you through whatever channel you prefer.

---

## Architecture

### The Orchestrator

A single LLM — the **orchestrator** — runs the show. It receives your message, decides what needs to happen, and delegates work to a team of specialized sub-agents. The orchestrator itself is designed to be a small, fast model (local Ollama) that routes and supervises rather than executing directly.

```
You → Orchestrator (small, local) → Atlas (large, cloud) → result → Orchestrator → You
                                   → Iris (email/calendar)
                                   → Dexter (scheduling)
                                   → Byte (projects)
                                   → Artemis (audit)
                                   → The Council (deliberation)
```

The orchestrator never touches the internet directly. It doesn't browse, it doesn't search, it doesn't fetch URLs. It delegates. This separation means the orchestrator can run on a cheap local model while the internet-connected agents run on the most capable models available.

### Sub-Agents

Each sub-agent has its own system prompt, its own toolset, and its own model. They don't share context — the orchestrator composes a self-contained task string with everything the sub-agent needs.

| Agent | Model | Tools | Role |
|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Atlas** | Local or cloud | Shell, browser, desktop, files, web search/fetch, documents | Execution — anything that touches the internet or runs commands. |
| **Iris** | Local or cloud (local recommended) | Email, calendar, contacts, todos | Personal information management. |
| **Dexter** | Local or cloud (local recommended) | Task scheduling, alarms, reminders | Time-based automation. |
| **Byte** | Local or cloud (local recommended) | Projects, deliverables, blockers, work tasks, time tracking | Work management. |
| **Artemis** | Local or cloud | Read-only file access | Critical review — audits conversations and decisions. |
| **The Council** | 3×, local or cloud | Read-only file access | Three independent seats (Skeptic, Pragmatist, Synthesist) deliberate in parallel on high-stakes decisions. |

Every agent's model is picked in the dashboard — local Ollama or cloud, your call. Local and cloud run through the **same Ollama pipeline** (see [Hybrid Model Architecture](#hybrid-model-architecture)), so switching an agent between them needs no code or infrastructure change. Iris, Dexter, and Byte are light, structured-task agents — run them on a local model and save cloud spend for Atlas and the Council.

### Async by Default

Atlas runs in the background. When the orchestrator delegates to Atlas, it gets a job ID back immediately and stays free to handle your next message. Results land in an **inbox** — the orchestrator drains it at turn end, digests what matters, and chains follow-up tasks. Urgent jobs can interrupt mid-turn. You're never stuck waiting for a long-running task to finish before you can keep talking.

### Persistent Runner

The agent-runner spawns as a persistent child process — no Docker, no containers, no cold starts between messages. It stays warm for hours (configurable `IDLE_TIMEOUT`), keeping MCP servers connected and skills loaded. Follow-up messages route over IPC in milliseconds.

---

## Prompt Engineering

This is the feature that makes Prometheus work. The system prompt isn't a paragraph of vibes — it's a carefully engineered control surface that has been iterated on extensively.

### Delegation Discipline

The orchestrator is trained to state **WHAT**, never **HOW**. It doesn't see the sub-agents' tools. It can't prescribe URLs, search queries, or step-by-step instructions. The system prompt explicitly forbids it:

> *"Atlas is the internet model. It runs on a larger, more capable model than you. Never tell Atlas how to use the internet — no URLs, no search queries, no 'go to X then click Y.' Give it the goal and the facts, and stop."*

This is reinforced at three layers: the orchestrator's system prompt, the Atlas tool description (what the orchestrator sees when deciding to call it), and Atlas's own system prompt (which tells it to ignore prescribed steps).

### Fabric Pattern Integration

Prometheus ships with hundreds of expert prompt patterns from the Fabric library. Every turn, the user's message is keyword-extracted and the top 5 most relevant patterns are injected into the system prompt by name and description. The orchestrator loads the full pattern on demand and bakes its framing into the Atlas task brief — giving the larger model the structure it needs without the orchestrator micromanaging the execution.

### Dynamic Tool Selection

Prometheus is built to host many tools at once — the core set plus anything you add via skills and MCP servers — so the tool surface had to scale without bloating every prompt. Not all 30+ tools go into every turn. Keywords from the conversation are extracted and tools are ranked by relevance; the core routing tools (sub-agents, Read, Bash) are always included, and everything else is surfaced only when relevant. This keeps the context window lean, the model focused, and the system futureproof — add a new tool and it's available without rethinking the prompt.

![Skills & MCP panel: dozens of toggled capabilities](docs/screenshots/skills.png)

### Defensive Loop Patterns

The tool loop has multiple circuit breakers to prevent common failure modes:
- **Intent-without-action detection** — if the model keeps saying "I'll do X" without actually calling tools, it gets nudged (capped at 2 nudges)
- **Circling detection** — consecutive useless rounds (no tool calls, no output) trigger a forced no-tools round to extract an answer
- **Degenerate output filter** — word-mash / garbled output from misconfigured models is detected and suppressed
- **Verifier sub-agent** — after effectful work (file writes, edits), a verifier pass confirms the changes

### Memory System

The orchestrator writes directly to `MEMORY.md`, `TODO.md`, and `HEARTBEAT.md` — no delegation needed. These files are loaded into context every turn. The heartbeat file is executed on schedule by the task scheduler, giving the agent persistent autonomous behavior.

![Heartbeat panel: scheduled instructions the AI executes automatically](docs/screenshots/heartbeat.png)

### Context Compaction

Long conversations are compacted by a Mercury summarization layer. Older turns are condensed into memory notes, keeping the active context window focused on what matters.

### Self-Editing

The agent can modify its own source. A built-in `self-edit` skill constrains edits to `src/` and `container/agent-runner/src/`, runs `npm run build`, gates on a successful compile, tells you what's changing, then restarts the service with `systemctl --user restart prometheus`. It refuses to touch `dist/`, configs, or the systemd unit, and never restarts on a failed build — so the agent can ship its own fixes without you opening a terminal.

---

## Hybrid Model Architecture

Prometheus is built for hybrid operation from the ground up. Different tasks need different models, and you shouldn't have to choose one and stick with it.

### How It Works

Every model selection in the dashboard is per-role:

| Role | Typical Model | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **Orchestrator** | Local (gemma, granite) | Fast, cheap, always available. Only routes and supervises. |
| **Atlas** | Cloud (deepseek, glm) | Heavy lifting — internet access, shell, browser, complex reasoning. |
| **Iris / Dexter / Byte** | Local (recommended) | Light, structured tasks. Run them local; save cloud for Atlas and the Council. |
| **Council seats** | Cloud (3 different models) | Diverse perspectives for deliberation. |
| **Sub-agent tools** | Configurable | Tool-calling sub-agents can use a different model. |

### One Pipeline, Local or Cloud

There is no separate infrastructure for cloud models. Ollama serves both local models (on your machine) and cloud models (remote Ollama-compatible endpoints) through the same HTTP API — so every agent can be flipped between local and cloud from the dashboard with no code or infrastructure change. You're just picking a model id. The credential proxy (port 3001) sits in front of it all so the agent never sees real API keys:
1. Validates the per-container auth token
2. Looks up and decrypts the user's API key
3. Forwards local models directly to `localhost:11434`
4. Translates to the cloud endpoint's format and injects the real key only at the proxy layer

> The repo also ships format-translation artifacts (`ollama-translate.ts`, `anthropic-translate.ts`) for anyone who wants to wire in Anthropic or OpenAI endpoints. They are not part of the default request path — by default everything is Ollama, local and cloud.

> The repo also ships format-translation artifacts (`ollama-translate.ts`, `anthropic-translate.ts`) for anyone who wants to wire in Anthropic or OpenAI endpoints. They are not part of the default request path — by default everything is Ollama, local and cloud.

### Session Storage

All conversation history lives in a single SQLite store (`agent_sessions`), shared across every model. There are no per-vendor session directories. Switching models mid-conversation keeps the same history.

## Real Browser Automation

Prometheus connects to your actual Chrome via Playwright and the Chrome DevTools Protocol (port 9222). Your real profile — cookies, sessions, saved passwords, extensions — everything is intact.

The browser tools operate on **DOM accessibility snapshots** and a complete set of DOM interaction tools. Each element gets a `[ref=e12]` identifier; the agent navigates, clicks, types, fills forms, selects dropdowns, hovers, switches tabs, takes screenshots, runs JavaScript with `browser_evaluate`, and waits for page state — all by ref or by URL. Screenshots exist for visual verification of end states.

Chrome runs as a persistent process with its own watchdog. It survives agent restarts. Sign into Google once; the profile persists forever.

---

## Desktop Control

Prometheus controls your actual desktop through built-in tools and MCP servers:

- **Built-in:** screenshots via `spectacle` and input synthesis via `xdotool` (mouse click, type text, send key combos). This works on X11; Wayland coverage depends on your compositor's xdotool compatibility.
- **KDE Plasma MCP server:** notifications, clipboard, opening URLs, reading current activity, KWin window verbs — all via D-Bus through the optional Plasma MCP server configured in `data/mcp-servers.json`.

It discovers the display environment automatically, even when started from systemd with no `DISPLAY` set.

---

## MCP Ecosystem

Model Context Protocol servers give agents real capabilities without touching core code:

![MCP server panel: filesystem, fetch, shell, memory, SQLite, time, plasma, and more](docs/screenshots/mcp.png)

| Server | Capability |
|--------|-----------|
| **Filesystem** | Read, write, edit, search, manage files |
| **Fetch** | Retrieve web content |
| **Shell** | Execute commands in a live PTY |
| **Memory** | Persistent knowledge graph |
| **SQLite** | Query and manage databases |
| **Time** | Timezone-aware scheduling |
| **Plasma** | KDE Plasma D-Bus (notifications, clipboard, windows) |

MCP servers are configured in `data/mcp-servers.json` and can be toggled from the dashboard.

---

## Channels

One conversation, many doors. All channels merge into a single chat:

- **Web Dashboard** — the PWA at port 3200
- **Telegram** — bot via grammy
- **WhatsApp** — via Baileys (no third-party API)
- **Slack** — bot integration

Message from WhatsApp, continue on Telegram, check the dashboard — same context, same memory.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> prometheus
cd prometheus
bash install.sh
```

The installer handles dependencies, TypeScript build, directory setup, and systemd service registration. Requires Node.js 20+ and Ollama.

```bash
# Service control (Linux)
systemctl --user start prometheus
systemctl --user kill prometheus   # fast stop
systemctl --user start prometheus  # restart

# Dashboard
open http://localhost:3200
```

## Voice Assistant

`voice/` is a voice-first desktop companion that turns Prometheus into a talk-to-it assistant. Press a button (or the global **F9** hotkey), speak, and the reply is spoken back. Speech-to-text (Whisper) and text-to-speech (Kokoro) run locally on your machine — your voice never leaves it. All reasoning, tools, and memory stay on the Prometheus server; the app is just ears, eyes, and a mouth.

- Push-to-talk or global hotkey. One press starts a conversation; press again to interrupt.
- Local STT (Whisper) and TTS (Kokoro) — audio is transcribed on device and discarded.
- Hologram UI that reflects state (idle / listening / thinking / speaking).
- Vision: capture a photo, describe a scene, read text (OCR), find objects.
- Browser and desktop control, email, and a timer ("take a break for 10 minutes").
- Talks to your existing Prometheus session — no new login.

![Hologram voice assistant interface](docs/screenshots/voice.png)

See `voice/README.md` for install and usage. Copy `voice/config/settings.example.yaml` to `voice/config/settings.yaml` (or run `python setup.py`) — `settings.yaml` holds your local server URL, user id, and an optional Cloudflare token, so it's gitignored and never committed.

---

## Configuration

All settings live in `data/env/env`:

```bash
ASSISTANT_NAME=Prometheus
TZ=America/Vancouver
IDLE_TIMEOUT=14400000          # 4h warm-runner window
OLLAMA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434
OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL=glm-5.2:cloud
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=            # from @BotFather
```

Model selection is per-role via the dashboard — orchestrator, Atlas, sub-agents, and council seats can all use different models.

---

## Why Prometheus?

Most AI assistants live in the cloud. They see what you type, not what you see. They run on someone else's hardware, with someone else's model, under someone else's terms.

![Safety warning modal shown on first dashboard launch](docs/screenshots/warning.png)

*This warning is not a joke — Prometheus runs with the same access as your user account. Read it before you continue.*

Prometheus runs on your machine. It uses your browser, your desktop, your files, your email. It works with local models through Ollama, so your data never leaves your hardware unless you choose to send it. And when you need more power, it reaches out to cloud models — all within the same conversation, with the same memory.

It's not a demo. It's a real assistant with browser automation, desktop control, voice, email, calendar, multi-channel messaging, a plugin ecosystem, an agent architecture that can reason about your work and audit its own decisions, and a prompt engineering surface that has been battle-tested across hundreds of hours of real use.

Prometheus stole fire from the gods. This one runs on your laptop.
